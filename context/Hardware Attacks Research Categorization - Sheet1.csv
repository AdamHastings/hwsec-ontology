SRBDS (CrossTalk) ✅,"CROSSTALK is a two-stage profiling framework designed to discover cross-core information leakage that occurs via Intel's shared staging buffer. The first stage, Instruction Profiling, utilizes performance counters to identify which x86 instructions make offcore memory requests. This process expands on prior work by testing instructions with diverse operands and in various contexts, such as different privilege levels, VM environments, and SGX enclaves, to comprehensively map microcode behavior. This revealed that context-dependent instructions, like CPUID and RDMSR, exhibit varying offcore request patterns depending on their inputs. The second stage, Staging Buffer Analysis, combines these results with MDS attacks to demonstrate that offcore requests flow through a globally-shared staging buffer. This stage uses ""masking primitives""—instructions writing known values—to map which instructions leak data at specific buffer offsets. The output is a catalog of ""leak primitives,"" or instructions that leak cross-core data, which notably includes RDRAND and RDSEED. The key innovation of this framework is its context-aware profiling, which reveals that instruction behavior depends heavily on operands, thereby uncovering cross-core leakage paths missed by previous static analysis.

A ""round"" refers to one complete cycle of the FLUSH+RELOAD technique used to extract data from the staging buffer

This is the sustained throughput - how fast an attacker can reliably transmit/leak information between two processes running on different physical CPU cores

Less than 5% of the leaked bytes are incorrect"
PACMAN 🟨,"The PACMAN attack combines memory corruption attacks and speculative execution attacks. An attacker can use the PACMAN attack to construct a PAC oracle to distinguish between a correct PAC and an incorrect PAC for an arbitrary pointer. The key insight of the PACMAN attack is to use speculative execution attacks to leak PAC verification results stealthily via micro-architectural side channels without causing crashes. We find several code patterns to be effectively used for this purpose, and we call these code patterns PACMAN gadgets

Page 4 under ""The Pacman Attack"" section ","The attacker first uses the PAC oracle to brute-force all possible PACs and find the matching PAC for the chosen address.
The attacker then bypasses the protection of Pointer Authentication by modifying the protected pointer using the matching PAC and
hijack the control flow of the victim

Page 4 under ""Threat Model"" section","The kernel is the most privileged part of your computer’s operating system. Compromising the kernel means that an attacker can do anything you can do (eg. read any file, see browser data, etc.). PACMAN works across privilege levels, so it works on the kernel from user mode. It is also important to recognize the fact that this attack can be remotely executed.","https://pacmanattack.com

For CPUs with FEAT_FPAC (faulting PAC): Insert XPAC instructions after authentication to clear PAC fields and prevent the ""oracle"" attack, though this has performance costs

For older CPUs without FPAC: Use speculation barriers after AUT instructions, but this has severe performance impact

Always: Continue using standard protections including PAC (since it still protects against ROP/JOP attacks), and patch memory corruption bugs in software

Key point: ARM still strongly recommends using Pointer Authentication despite PACMAN, because without it, attackers could easily create ROP/JOP gadgets. The mitigation is layered - fix software bugs AND use hardware defenses where available.","Due to this attack's ability to compromise the kernel, mitigation should be a priority",Refer to mitigation vector column,"Using fence/isb instructions after pointer authentication instructions to pause speculative execution could incur significant performance penalty, as these instructions are very common in programs protected using Pointer Authentication
