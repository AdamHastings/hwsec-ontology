\section{Motivating Problem and Scope}
\subsection{What Counts as a Security Cost?}
Security costs include direct design overhead (area and energy), verification
and validation effort, software/hardware co-design complexity, certification and
compliance burdens, opportunity costs from constrained design space, and
post-incident costs (recall, liability, and reputational damage)
\cite{anderson2001economics,anderson2006economics}.

\subsection{System Boundary}
This draft focuses on security mechanisms and requirements that affect:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Microarchitecture and SoC design,
  \item Platform firmware and trusted boot chains,
  \item Supply-chain assurance and lifecycle support,
  \item Product and organizational decision-making.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Goals}
To keep the ontology tractable in the first version, this paper does not
attempt to fully model:
\begin{itemize}
  \item purely software-only control economics with no hardware or firmware coupling,
  \item geopolitical or national-security externalities beyond product and operator contexts,
  \item attacker utility models and adversary adaptation dynamics in full game-theoretic detail,
  \item jurisdiction-specific legal doctrine for liability allocation.
\end{itemize}
