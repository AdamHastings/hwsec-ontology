\section{Motivating Problem and Scope}
\subsection{What Counts as a Security Cost?}
Security costs include direct design overhead (area and energy), verification
and validation effort, software/hardware co-design complexity, certification and
compliance burdens, opportunity costs from constrained design space, and
post-incident costs (recall, liability, and reputational damage)
\cite{anderson2001economics,anderson2006economics}.

\subsection{System Boundary}
This paper focuses on security mechanisms and requirements that affect
microarchitecture and SoC design, platform firmware and trusted boot chains,
supply-chain assurance and lifecycle support, reactive detection/recovery
pipelines, and product-level organizational decision-making.

\subsection{Non-Goals}
To keep the ontology tractable in the first version, this paper does not
attempt to fully model purely software-only control economics without hardware
or firmware coupling, geopolitical externalities beyond product and operator
contexts, attacker utility and adaptation in full game-theoretic detail, or
jurisdiction-specific legal doctrine for liability allocation.
