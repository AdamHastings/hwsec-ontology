\section{Analytical Framework}
\subsection{Decision Rules}
We compare two explicit decision rules. \textbf{Local-overhead logic} optimizes
primarily on mechanism-local deltas (for example runtime, power, or area).
\textbf{Allocation-aware logic} optimizes lifecycle burden allocation across
stakeholders and time horizons, including transfer and externality terms.

\subsection{Multi-Stakeholder Cost Accounting}
Define total expected cost as a function of direct implementation costs,
probability-weighted incident losses, and cost-shifting terms:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
C_{\text{total}} =\;& C_{\text{direct}} + \mathbb{E}[L_{\text{incident}}] + C_{\text{compliance}} \\
& + C_{\text{opportunity}} + C_{\text{externalized}}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
This equation is intended as an accounting checklist, not a claim that every
term can be estimated with equal confidence. Its purpose is to prevent common
omissions (for example, counting local PPA impact while ignoring externalized
incident burden).

\subsection{Formal Comparison}
\begin{equation}
\textit{Rule}_{\text{local}}:\;\arg\min_m\; \Delta \text{Perf}(m)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\textit{Rule}_{\text{alloc}}:\;\arg\min_m\; \sum_{s,t} w_{s,t}\,C_{s,t}(m)
\end{equation}
where $C_{s,t}(m)$ is burden borne by stakeholder $s$ at lifecycle phase $t$,
and $w_{s,t}$ is a stakeholder-time weighting policy.

\subsection{Information-Gap Prioritization}
To reduce decision uncertainty, we rank family-cost cells for additional
measurement effort using a simple VOI proxy:
\begin{equation}
\textit{VOI}(f,c)=\alpha U_{f,c}+\beta T_{f,c}+\gamma I_f
\end{equation}
where $U_{f,c}$ captures uncertainty prevalence (E2/E3 density), $T_{f,c}$
captures transfer/externalization prevalence, and $I_f$ captures incident-link
density for family $f$. In the current release, $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)=(1.0,1.2,0.8)$.
This turns CQ6 into an executable ranking task rather than a narrative future
work item.
