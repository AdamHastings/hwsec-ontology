\section{Analytical Framework}
\subsection{Multi-Stakeholder Cost Accounting}
Define total expected cost as a function of direct implementation costs,
probability-weighted incident losses, and cost-shifting terms:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
C_{\text{total}} =\;& C_{\text{direct}} + \mathbb{E}[L_{\text{incident}}] + C_{\text{compliance}} \\
& + C_{\text{opportunity}} + C_{\text{externalized}}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Risk Transfer and Incentive Misalignment}
A key claim of this draft is that many hardware security decisions optimize
local objective functions while externalizing residual risk, which mirrors
established observations from security economics \cite{anderson2001economics,anderson2006economics}.
The ontology captures these transfers explicitly.
