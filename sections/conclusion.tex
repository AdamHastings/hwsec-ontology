\section{Conclusion}
Security in hardware is not merely an additive technical feature; it is a
cross-layer allocation of resources, constraints, and risk. A cost ontology can
make these allocations explicit and comparable, enabling more coherent
engineering and policy decisions. The next milestone is empirical execution:
populate the ontology with measured case data, run competency-query coverage
tests, and publish reproducible artifacts that support independent scrutiny.
