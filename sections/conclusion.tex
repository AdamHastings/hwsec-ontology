\section{Conclusion}
Security in hardware is not merely an additive technical feature; it is a
cross-layer allocation of resources, constraints, and risk. A cost ontology can
make these allocations explicit and comparable, enabling more coherent
engineering and policy decisions. The paradigm contribution of this paper is to
make that allocation explicit and contestable: mechanism evaluation should report
who pays, who benefits, and who bears residual risk, not only local overhead.
Future work should broaden mechanism coverage, complete incident-loss linkage,
and test whether allocation-aware reasoning changes real procurement and design
decisions at scale.
